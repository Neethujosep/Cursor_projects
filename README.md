## Workspace Overview

This repository now hosts two separate projects:

1) `python_insights/` – Customer Insight Generator (Python + SQL + pandas/numpy/matplotlib)
2) `cpp_control/` – Cross‑platform C++17 control backend (CMake)

See each subfolder's `README.md` for setup, build, and run instructions.
